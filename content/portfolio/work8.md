Originally released in Germany without a title in 2019, Opus der Zweite was held
up in court for many months while Karl went through bankruptcy proceedings.
Finally out the other side, we bring you this wonderful collection of tracks
that really nails the zeitgeist of what it means to live fully in modern society.
