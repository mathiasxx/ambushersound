An exciting MIDSUMMER release from the self-quarantined Ambusher.

Painstakingly recorded in basements and outdoor cafes, this third release
arrives at the perfect time with two tracks guaranteed to make you forget that
while you have been holed up in your apartment sipping cocktails, the world
outside has descended into madness.

Find it on your favorite streaming service, or download it from [Bandcamp](https://ambusher.bandcamp.com/).
